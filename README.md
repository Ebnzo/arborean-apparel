You're going to need a thing to dump the images into `www/img/` and the items into `www/items.json` – check the `scripts` directory for those.

You may want to run the server – check the `server` directory for that. Don't forget to update the `net.connect()` call at the end of `index.js` to point to the server.

I'm not including any assets from TERA in here.
